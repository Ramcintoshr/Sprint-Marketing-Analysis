# Sprint-Marketing-Analysis
Churn analysis and KPI reporting for telecom campaign data

# Sprint Campaign Analysis (Simulated)

This project simulates a campaign analysis I conducted while working on brand campaigns for Sprint and T-Mobile. While actual data and queries were proprietary, this example reflects the structure and logic of the work I performed, including churn tracking, customer segmentation, and KPI reporting.

## Tools Used
- SQL (BigQuery-style syntax)
- Tableau (simulated dashboard)
- Excel (campaign data mock-up)

## Objectives
- Segment customers by plan type, tenure, and engagement level
- Track monthly churn rates across campaigns and regions
- Forecast retention based on historical behavior and offer response
- Deliver performance insights to marketing and CRM teams

## What’s Included
- `campaign_analysis.sql`: Sample SQL used for churn rate calculation and segmentation
- (Optional) Screenshot of Tableau dashboard [coming soon]

## ⚠Note
All data, queries, and results are **simulated** and created solely for demonstration purposes.
